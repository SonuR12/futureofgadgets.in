### Console Output (Development Mode)
When emails are sent, you'll see:
```
📧 Email would be sent to: user@example.com
📧 Subject: Verify your email - Future Of Gadegets
📧 Verification link: http://localhost:3000/auth/verify-email?token=abc123...
```

### Toast Notifications
You'll see toast messages for:
- ✅ Account created

- ❌ Invalid credentials
- ❌ Token expired

### UI Changes
- Yellow verification banner for unverified users
- "Forgot Password?" link in sign-in dialog
- Forgot password form view
- Email verification page
- Password reset page

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Token expired" error
- Tokens expire after 24 hours
- Request a new verification/reset email

### Can't find verification link
- Check terminal/console output
- Look for lines starting with 📧
- Copy the full URL including token

### Password validation error
Password must have:
- At least 8 characters
- At least one letter (a-z or A-Z)
- At least one number (0-9)
- At least one special character (!@#$%^&*(),.?":{}|<>)

Example valid passwords:
- `Test@123`
- `MyPass123!`
- `Secure#2024`

### Email not sending (with SMTP setup)
- Check SMTP credentials are correct
- Verify SMTP_HOST and SMTP_PORT
